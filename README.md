# RTSAI

Gameplay Summary:  
The game is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game that matches a player against an AI in a race of domination. 
This game is based on the 4X genre (eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate, and eXplore). 
The goal is to destroy the enemy's main building.
Each player has a limited amount of construction points, and starts with a main building. 
He can spend them to spawn different units from buildings or construct a new building. 
When a unit or a building dies, the player retrieves the construction points that were spent making it.
He can select multiple units to give them orders, like capturing a capture point or attacking
the enemyâ€™s buildings or units. When a capture point is captured, the player capturing it
gains construction points to make more units.
The player needs to feel the intensity of the match against the AI and needs to be creative to
win against the AI to take advantage of its weakness.
